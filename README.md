# üöó Car Listing Assistant
This project is a modular AI-powered app that helps users list cars for sale by uploading an image and a description. It extracts structured data using LangChain + Azure OpenAI, simulates car type detection, and sends the results via email.

### üì¶ Features
- üñºÔ∏è Upload car image via Streamlit GUI

- üìù Input free-text car description

- ü§ñ Extract structured JSON using GPT-4o mini (LangChain + Azure OpenAI)

- üß™ Simulate car type detection via dummy image classifier

- üìß Send JSON + image to designated Gmail address

- üîê Prevent prompt injection with basic input sanitization

- üß∞ Modular design for future CV model integration

### Solution Creation Prompt:
we want to create a simple GUI to Enable users to upload a car image and input a text description using
streamlit library and Use the GPT-4o mini model (via LangChain/LangGraph) to convert the input text into a structured JSON format ,
Implement some simple measures to prevent the user from misusing the tool ,and send the car image and json file to a gmail address
and Create a dummy function for image classification to simulate car type detection, enabling future integration with the real CV model
